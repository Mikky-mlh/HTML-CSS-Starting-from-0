# 🧑‍💻 HTML & CSS: My Personal "Starting from Zero" Log

## 📝 Hey, Welcome! (Introduction)

This repository is essentially my **personal learning journal** for mastering HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals. I'm starting completely from scratch (or maybe re-learning everything the right way!), and I've set this up to organize my notes, practice files, and small projects.

If you're also a beginner, please feel free to use this resource to guide your own learning!

## 🎯 My Personal Goal

The main goal for me is to take myself from a complete beginner to someone who can confidently:

1.  Structure a complex webpage using **semantic HTML5**.
2.  Style and layout that page beautifully using modern **CSS3** techniques like **Flexbox** and **Grid**.
3.  Build a portfolio-ready site so I can move on to learning Flask/backend development next!
